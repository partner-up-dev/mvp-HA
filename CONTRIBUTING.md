## Commit And Release Policy

This repository is primarily changed by AI Coding agents, so commit and release
metadata must be explicit enough for automation to preserve product history.

- Use Conventional Commits for all commits that may reach `master`.
- Use `feat(<scope>): ...` for user-visible capabilities or release-worthy
  behavior additions.
- Use `fix(<scope>): ...` for user-visible bug fixes or release-worthy
  correctness changes.
- Use `perf(<scope>): ...` only when the performance change is release-worthy.
- Use `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, or `build` only when the change
  should not create a product release note.
- Do not hide release-worthy behavior behind `refactor`, `chore`, or vague
  messages. If a refactor changes observable behavior, classify the observable
  part as `feat` or `fix`.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` in the commit type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  footer.
- Prefer scopes that match the affected owner, such as `backend`, `frontend`,
  `event`, `pr`, `admin`, `deploy`, or `release`.

Release Please owns app versions, changelog entries, release tags, and GitHub
Release notes after the `0.3.0` bootstrap baseline:

- Backend release state lives in `apps/backend/package.json`,
  `apps/backend/CHANGELOG.md`, and tags named `backend-vX.Y.Z`.
- Frontend release state lives in `apps/frontend/package.json`,
  `apps/frontend/CHANGELOG.md`, and tags named `frontend-vX.Y.Z`.
- Do not manually bump app `package.json` versions except for explicit release
  automation bootstrap or a human-approved recovery.
- Do not manually edit generated changelog release sections. Improve future
  changelog content through better commits or Release Please commit overrides
  on the merged PR body.
- Backend GitHub Releases represent successful production deployment, not just
  source availability.
- Frontend GitHub Releases currently represent source releases because frontend
  deployment is pull-based and GitHub CI cannot observe deployment success.
