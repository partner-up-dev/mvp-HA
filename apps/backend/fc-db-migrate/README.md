# db-migrate (Aliyun FC Internal Function)

This function runs the backend database migration runner inside Aliyun FC, so the migration execution happens from the VPC instead of the GitHub Actions runner.

## Files

- Handler entry: `db-migrate-handler.cjs`
- Bundled migration runtime: `.fc-package/db-migrate.js`
- FC template: `s.yaml`

## Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL` (required)
  Database connection string used by the migration runner.
- `DB_SCRIPT_ROOT` (set by handler)
  Points the shared migration loader at the packaged `drizzle/` and `data-migrations/` directories.

## Runtime Behavior

1. Load the bundled migration runtime from the current deployment package.
2. Point the migration loader at the packaged repository root.
3. Run the same `runMigrations()` implementation used by local `pnpm db:migrate`.
4. Return success only when every pending migration has either been applied or skipped safely.

## Packaging

The deployment package is prepared by `scripts/ci/fc/prepare_fc_db_migrate_package.sh`.
It contains:

- `db-migrate-handler.cjs`
- `db-migrate.js`
- `package.json`
- `drizzle/`
- `data-migrations/`

## Deployment

This function is deployed and invoked by `.github/workflows/backend-fc-deploy.yml` before the main backend FC deploy step.
