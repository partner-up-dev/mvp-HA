# Result: Documentation System Setup

## Summary

- Added product documentation structure under `docs/product/` with overview, feature docs, and glossary.
- Seeded initial feature docs for share-to-xhs and find-partner with required sections only.
- Recorded the documentation workflow in root `AGENTS.md`.

## Files Changed

- `docs/product/overview.md`
- `docs/product/features/share-to-xhs.md`
- `docs/product/features/find-partner.md`
- `docs/product/glossary.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

## Notes

- Feature docs intentionally stay minimal per the requested PRD-to-code workflow.
