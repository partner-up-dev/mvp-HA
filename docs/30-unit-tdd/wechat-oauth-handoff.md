# WeChat OAuth Handoff Unit TDD

## Role

The WeChat OAuth handoff unit preserves a safe browser return path after WeChat redirects back to the backend OAuth callback.

It exists because the product currently uses frontend-held application access tokens, while OAuth callback completion must not expose long-lived bearer credentials in URL query parameters.

## Durable Inputs

- Product TDD session contract: `docs/20-product-tdd/cross-unit-contracts.md`
- Backend callback and handoff route: `apps/backend/src/controllers/wechat.controller.ts`
- Frontend app gate and exchange flow: `apps/frontend/src/processes/wechat/*`
- Frontend auth bootstrap: `apps/frontend/src/processes/auth/useAuthSessionBootstrap.ts`
- Route share orchestration: `apps/frontend/src/domains/share/use-cases/useRouteShareOrchestrator.ts`

## Local Invariants

- The backend OAuth navigation callback must not put the frontend access token, WeChat OAuth access token, code, or state into `returnTo`.
- The `wechatOAuthHandoff` query value is a nonce only. Treat it as non-secret but sensitive enough to remove from browser-visible URLs and telemetry.
- The signed handoff cookie is short-lived, HttpOnly, path-scoped to the handoff endpoint, and must not contain the frontend access token.
- Handoff exchange must use `credentials: "include"` so the path-scoped signed cookie reaches the backend.
- Handoff exchange is single-use from the frontend perspective: success removes the nonce from the address bar and applies the returned auth session.
- Auth bootstrap must defer while a handoff nonce is pending. It must not register or refresh an anonymous session before the handoff gate resolves.
- Route auto-login must not redirect to WeChat while a handoff nonce is pending.
- Route share orchestration must not build share targets or revisions from a route that still contains the handoff nonce.

## UX Semantics

- The app should mount immediately; handoff must not create a blank pre-mount wait.
- The route content remains gated while handoff is pending, so page-level queries and route auto-login do not run under the wrong anonymous identity.
- Slow network is a UI state, not immediate failure. After the slow threshold, show an explicit pending state while the original exchange continues.
- A user may choose to continue as a visitor. That action cancels the local wait, removes the nonce from the URL, and lets normal auth bootstrap proceed.
- Failed handoff should offer retry while the nonce remains present and the backend cookie may still be valid.

## Failure Semantics

- Missing, mismatched, expired, or already-consumed handoff data is a failed handoff, not an anonymous success.
- Retrying is valid only while the URL still contains the nonce.
- Clearing the URL nonce is the boundary after which the app should stop trying to complete that handoff.
- Backend errors should not leak OAuth provider details or bearer credentials to the route.

## Verification Expectations

For code changes in this unit:

- Run backend typecheck when backend callback, cookie, route, or payload code changes.
- Run frontend build when frontend gate, auth bootstrap, router, or share orchestration code changes.
- Confirm sensitive route cleaning still covers `code`, `state`, `access_token`, `token`, and `wechatOAuthHandoff`.
- Review the redirect sequence manually when changing callback URLs or cookie options:
  1. WeChat redirects to backend callback.
  2. Backend validates state and identifies/upgrades the user.
  3. Backend sets short-lived handoff cookie and redirects to `returnTo` with nonce.
  4. Frontend gate exchanges nonce with credentials included.
  5. Frontend applies auth session and removes nonce before rendering route content.
